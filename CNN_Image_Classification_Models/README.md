# CNN Image Classification Models

##  By KJ MoChroi

In this exercise I train two different CNN models on different image datasets. The first is a CNN Model on the MNIST handwritten number dataset which yields a result of 99% accuracy on validation. The second model is a CNN on the CIFAR10 small image dataset which yields a lower accuracy of 70%. I also tried adding data augmentation and holdout to the second model but it didn't improve the results. Finally at the end of the file I use a pretrained neural network to make classification predictions on images I gathered myself.
