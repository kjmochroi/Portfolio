# Combining Datasets Exercise
## By KJ MoChroi

In this project I imported data from multiple sources including CSV, API (JSON) and an SQL database and combined them into one data frame so that I could look at the relationship between the Happiness Index and the Gender Development Index for each country. 

In order to complete this project, I had to learn to do a handful of new things, and I was able to practice some skills that had been introduced to me in other courses. Starting with the things that are completely new to me, I pulled data from an API for the first time when learning to do this project. I also performed web scraping on a table from an html website for the first time. Once I had gotten my data, I was able to use my python skills to clean the data, like I had been taught to do in previous courses. However, once the dataframes were ready I had to learn how to convert them to tables inside an SQL database. I also ended up learning how to join tables inside databases, how to do string manipulation methods with SQL, and how to convert from a table in an SQL database back to a pandas dataframe.
