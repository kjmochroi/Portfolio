# Airline Safety Dashboard  

## By KJ MoChroi

This was an assignment I completed for a class called 'Data Visualization' where I was given a dataset containing statistics on airline fatalities and I was asked to create a dashboard that would provide evidence that travel via airplane is safe. The target audience for this dashboard is an internal team in the marketing department of an airline in the U.S. who are hoping to share some marketing materials to the public that will reassure the public that airline travel is safe.

I'm sharing this in an effort to highlight my data visualization and data presentation skills.

Note that I changed my name in 2023 and these materials refer to me by my former name.
