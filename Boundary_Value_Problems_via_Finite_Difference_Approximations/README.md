# Boundary Value Problems via Finite Difference Approximations

Note that I changed my name in 2023 and these materials refer to me by my former name.  
  
   
During the Summer of 2017 I had the opportunity to participate in original mathematical research with my collaborator Sara Stout and our advisor, Paul T. Allen, Ph.D. We wrote a mathematical proof which showed that boundary value problems of a particular form must have a unique solution, using only mathematical tools available to an undergraduate student. In this folder you will find PDFs of our short paper, our presentation, and a poster that we made.
